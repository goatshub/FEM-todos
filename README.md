## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- TypeScript
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) â€” for styling
- [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/tree/master) - for drag and drop
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - For backend
- [React Firebase Hooks](https://github.com/CSFrequency/react-firebase-hooks)

### What I learned

Using react-beautiful-dnd with TypeScripts needs to install its types.

```
npm i --save-dev @types/react-beautiful-dnd
```

It also needs to be dynamically imported.

```js
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
const MainSection = dynamic(() => import("./mainSection"), {
  ssr: false,
});
export default MainSection;
```
