## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- TypeScript
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) â€” for styling
- [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/tree/master) - for drag and drop
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - For backend
- [React Firebase Hooks](https://github.com/CSFrequency/react-firebase-hooks)

### What I learned

Using react-beautiful-dnd with TypeScripts needs to install its types.

```
npm i --save-dev @types/react-beautiful-dnd
```

It also needs to be dynamically imported.

```js
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
const MainSection = dynamic(() => import("./mainSection"), {
  ssr: false,
});
export default MainSection;
```

I made this project into a full stack app with Firebase as database.

It is better to keep index of the todo in separated array. Not in todo object itself so that we don't need to write many updates back to database.

I have also tried applying Firebase anon auth and account linking with Google provider to save user's data.
